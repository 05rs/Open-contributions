- **What is OpenCV?**
    
    Basically, OpenCV means **Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning Software** Library. As the name suggests, OpenCV has plays a major role in the field of *Computer Vision*. This is a highly optimized library that has enormous scope in *real-time applications*. The optimized algorithms which are more than 2500 in number have proved to be extremely useful in developing models of *Artificial Intelligence* and *Computer Vision*. Important aspect of OpenCV is that it's an *image processing* library that can *process* images, videos and even make use of webcams to *capture* images and videos.
- **OpenCV in Computer Vision:**
  
  **Computer Vision** is a scientific field that helps the computer to access and process digital images and videos as if it can "**see**". *Main goal* of Computer Vision is to provide the computer systems the capacity to *interpret and understand* digital images and videos at a higher level and even react to what they *see*.
  
- **Images**:

  Images are nothing but collection of *pixels*. Different values are assigned to each pixel in the image that determines its *color*. To clearly understand the concept of images, consider a *5X5 grid* that has 5 rows and 5 columns as below:

  If each of the rows is numbered from 1 to 5 and each of the columns is also numbered from 1 to 5, then **the color of individual blocks (i,j)** where *i represents row number and j represents column number*, can be changed that makes the grid colorful. Similarly, *pixels* of the image are assigned values to determine their colors, hence resulting in the desired image.

  The above image shows how some of the blocks are assigned the color "Green" to make the grid appear different. **This simpler tactic is applied in creating and processing images**. OpenCV basically processes the images by *acquiring the information of each pixel in the image and modifying it as per the requirement*. The idea behind accessing and processing videos remains the same since *videos are nothing but a sequence of images*. The quality of an image depends on the *resolution* where as quality of a video depends on the *number of frames per second*.
