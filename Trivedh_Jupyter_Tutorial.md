<h1>Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<p>Jupyter notebook is an interactive and powerful tool to create the realtime projects like datascience projects. 
It is an open source web application. It is used widely to create the documents that contain live codes,text,graphs/visualization.Jupyter notebook combines the output and code in
a single file i.e, a user can type the code,run it and see the otput. Jupyter notebook is not built-in or included in python,it has to be installed.</p>
<h2> Installation</h2>
Jupyter notebook can be installed in the following two ways:<br>
<ul><li>Download Anaconda</li><li>Using pip of python</li></ul>
<ol><li>Download Anaconda:<br>
<p>Anaconda integrates many of the tools used in data science and machine learning with just one install. It is widely used for creating data science and other real-time projects.
It includes many python libraries which include numpy,pandas,matplotlib,Jupyter,etc.</p></li>
<li>Using pip:<br>
<p> Using python tool pip, type the following command in the terminal.</p><br>
<i> pip install jupyter</i>
<h2>Creating a notebook</h2>
<p> Now the first task is to get familiar with the notebook interface and creating the first notebok file. Run the jupyter using Anaconda shortcut found on the start menu or desktop
which will open a newtab as shown below</p>

<p> It is not the jupyter notebook, its just a launchpad for editing and creating the notebooks. The url of the dashboard should look like this: <i>http://localhost:8888/tree</i>.
Now click on the new button on the top right corner, it will open up a dropbox or a list of options. Select python 3 or python 2. Then the webpage should look like this.</p>

<p> now at the top of the page, you could see <i> Untitiled</i> on the left corner of the file i.e the notebook is not labeled yet. The extension of Jupyter notebook is .ipynb.
Just click on the "Untitled". It pops up a dialog box asking to rename notebook. We can rename with name we want to title the file.</p>
<h2>Getting familiar with the interface and terminology</h2>
<p>The two terms to get familiar with are:<br>
<ol><li>Cells: Cell is an input ccontainer for the code to be executed and to display the text in the notebook.</li>
<li>Kernel: Kernel is a computational engine that executes the code in a notebook document. It computes the code in the file</li></ol>
<p>Cells are mainly of two types:<br>
<b>Code cells</b> contain the code to be executed.<br>
<b>Markdown cells</b> contain text which should not be considered as a code in the document. It displays the text which can be formatted using markdown language. A normal cell can be converted 
into markdown cell from cell menu on the top. Example pics of markdown and normal cell.<br>
