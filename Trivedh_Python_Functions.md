# Functions in Python
<h2>Definition</h2>: 
Function is a block of code or set of statements that performs a specific task and executes only when called.
Complex projects can be broken down into smaller tasks.These small tasks can contain multiple lines of code and can be used multiple times in the same program.

<h3>In the above syntax:</h3><br>
<b>def</b> - to declare/define the function<br>
<b>function-name</b>- name of the function<br>
<b>()</b> - required to distinguish between a variable and function and end the definition with a semi-colon<br>
<h3>There are two basic types of Functions:</h3><br>
<ul><li>Built-in Functions</li>
<li>User Defined Functions</li></ul>
<h2>Built-in Functions:</h2><br>
Built-in functions are part of Python language.These are the functions readily available for the use.
<h3>Examples</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>max()</td>
<td>Returns the largest item in an iterable</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
  <td>min()</td>
<td>Returns the smallest item in an iterable</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
  <td>input()</td>
<td>To accept the input from the user</td>
</tr>
  </table>
  
  

<h2>User defined Functions:</h2><br>
User defined functions are not in-built and are not a part of Python programming language.Any name can be given to the function.These are the functions are defined according to the need of the user to carry out the tasks.
<h3>Examples</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>def sub(x,y):<br>
        &nbsp; diff=x-y<br>
        &nbsp; print(diff)<br><br>
    sub(7,4)</td>
  <td>Prints the difference between two numbers</td>
</tr>
