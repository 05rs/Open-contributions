# **Conditionals:**

***What are Conditional statements?***

Conditional statements have a boolean(True or False) condition . 
If the condition evaluates to True , all the indented statements are executed.
If the condition evaluates to False , then , all the indented statements are ignored and next line is executed.

***Need of Conditional statements:***

We need conditional statements in our program to change the direction of program according to the conditions.

***Types of conditional statements***:
<ul>
<li>if statement</li>
<li>if-else statement</li>
<li>Chained conditional statemets</li>
<li>Nested conditional statements</li>
</ul>


***Let's take a look at all the statements:***

1.<b>If statements</b>

When we have a condition or boolen expression to check , we use if condition.

<p>Syntax:</p>
<p><PRE>
        if boolean condition:<br>
           statement(s)</p>
            
Example:
<PRE> if a>b:
        print(a)
      <ul>
      <li>Here, ':' is used to mark the starting of statement(s) inside if block.</li>
      <li> 'a>b' is the boolean condition</li>
      <li>If this boolean condition evaluates to True , then the statements inside the if block will be executed</li>
      <li>'print(a)' here , is the statement inside the if block , which will be executed only if the boolean condition evalutes to True</li>
      <li>If the condition evalutes to false the statement(s) inside the if block will be ignored , and rest of the statements will be executed.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Let's take an example from our daily life:</p>
        <p>Example: If it is rainiing, use an umbrella otherwise don't use an umbrella.</p>
        <p>Explanation: Here , the condition is "if it is raining" , if this condition evaluates to true , then we use an umbrella ,otherwise, it is not raining so we don't need the umbrella.</p>
        <p>Now, let us take a look at the flowchart:</p>

        <p>Thus, this flowchart explain us the flow of the program using 'if' conditional statement.</p>
